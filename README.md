# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
A machine learning project that uses classification algorithms to predict customer attrition for a bank.

- [Streamlit App](https://mldschurnprediction.streamlit.app/)
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers)

## Problem
Banks must adjust their marketing efforts and provide products to clients whom are more likely to stay with a bank. This can save the bank a lot of time, money, and resources.

## Action & Solution
As a team, six members of the Baruch MLDS club along with myself did the following:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Encoding
3. Training Multiple Classification Models
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Evaluation

After saving the model, the team created a simple streamlit interface which takes in features like the client's age, months with a bank, total transaction amount (for the past 12 months), and the total revolving balance, to predict the likeliness of a customer's stay with the bank.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the terminal and run

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. Have fun!

## Next Steps

There are multiple improvements that can be done for this project:
- Find a solution to the class imbalance
- Custom Feature Engineering
- Train a LightGBM
- Collect more data

## Credits

None of this would be possible without the awesome libraries Python comes with and most importantly, the team I guided and taught for the duration of the semester at Baruch College.
